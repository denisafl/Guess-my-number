# Guess-my-number
This project was made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

The initial score of the project is 20. That means that you have 20 changes to try to guess the number.
If you guess it in the first try, then the score will be 20, otherwise the score will decrease with 1 at every wrong answer.
For example, if you try twice and at the third try the answer is correct, the score will be 18.
